# Introduction

## Welcome!

In this book, we'll cover the basics of writing an interpreter with Rust. The book will (eventually) cover 2 different architectural approaches:

1. Tree-walk interpreter
2. Bytecode machine

### Required knowledge

This book assumes you have a basic understanding of Rust, so you don't need to be an expert.

If you know how to write a function and a struct, you'll be good to go. There's no doubt you'll learn some things along the way.

## Credit

The content in this book is heavily inspired by [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Both books use languages other than Rust, but I definitely recommend checking them out. The overall concepts are the same and can be applied in most, if not all, languages.
